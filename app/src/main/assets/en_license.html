These Terms and the documents that are referred to herein constitute a binding obligation between you and Cobo Global HK Limited, the seller of Cobo. To make these Terms easier to read, App, Wallet, Hardware and our associated services are collectively called the "<strong>Services</strong>." A "<strong>Virtual Currency</strong>" is any blockchain-based currency or token such as Bitcoin. The use of our website located at <u>https://cobo.com</u> (the "Site") is governed by our general website terms of use <u>https://webview.cobo.com/internal/des/toc</u>.

In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Cobo and you with respect to this Services and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, agreements and understandings between Cobo and you with respect to the subject matter hereof.

<strong>2. Privacy Policy.</strong> Please refer to our Privacy Policy for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy.

<strong>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND COBO THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE CAREFULLY REVIEW THE "DISPUTE RESOLUTION" SECTION BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION (INCLUDING THE PROCEDURE TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION).</strong>

<strong>3. Changes to Terms or Services.</strong> We may update the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the updated Terms on the Site or through other communications. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the updated Terms, then, except as otherwise provided the "Dispute Resolution" Section you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

<strong>4. Who May Use the Services?</strong>

<strong>(a)</strong> Eligibility. You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older, capable of forming a binding contract with Cobo) and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.

<strong>(b)</strong> Registration and Your Information. If you want to use certain features of the Services you'll have to create an account ("<strong>Account</strong>"). You can do this via the Site or through your account with certain third-party social networking services such as Facebook or Twitter (each, an "<strong>SNS Account</strong>"). If you choose the SNS Account option we'll create your Account by extracting from your SNS Account certain personal information such as your name and email address and other personal information that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access.

<strong>(c)</strong> Accuracy of Account Information. It's important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don't, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account.

You're responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.

<strong>5. Hardware, Wallet and Description of Services.</strong>

<strong>(a)</strong> General. Cobo offers a hierarchical deterministic Virtual Currency wallet that implements the BIP44 blockchain protocol ("<strong>Wallet</strong>"). It is powered by Hardware in which a tablet-like device containing a security chip randomly generates a 24-word mnemonic phrase ("<strong>Mnemonic Phrase</strong>") and master seed to derive pairs of private and public keys to manage Virtual Currencies.

<strong>(b)</strong> Use of the Services with Virtual Currency. Please note that neither the Wallet nor do any of the Services "hold" Virtual Currency, but rather facilitates the interaction between the holder of the Virtual Currency and the underlying blockchain network that processes the transactions. Public keys allow you to receive and deposit Virtual Currency, whereas private keys allow you to send Virtual Currency outside of your account. To complete a Virtual Currency transaction, a user downloads the App on a mobile device, begins a transaction, and generates a QR code that is scanned by the Wallet, which will then  complete the transaction by providing the private key for signature authority (provided however, that the user must control the Mnemonic Phrase and any other necessary passwords and details). After the transaction is signed by the Wallet, it generates a QR code that is scanned by the App on the mobile device, which then broadcasts the transaction to the blockchain via the internet. The App can only be used in conjunction with the Wallet and for no other purpose.

<strong>(c)</strong> Passwords. The Mnemonic Phrase and any password that you select in connection with your use of the Wallet is not known or otherwise stored by Cobo. Using the Mnemonic Phrase, your private key can be recovered on any BIP44-compatible wallet. IF YOU LOSE OR OTHERWISE FORGET YOUR MNEMONIC PHRASE, THEN NEITHER YOU NOR COBO WILL BE UNABLE TO RETRIEVE YOUR PRIVATE KEY, as the Wallet hardware is designed to resist tampering. The Wallet is designed to be separated and unconnected from the internet to provide further security against hacking, however no solution is theft-proof, including the Wallet.

<strong>(d)</strong> Firmware. In order to support certain functionality, such as new forks of Virtual Currency, firmware upgrades will be needed to be installed onto the Wallet per any instructions by Cobo.

<strong>(e)</strong> Sole Responsibility. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECURITY AND AVAILABILITY OF YOUR MNEMONIC PHRASE, PRIVATE KEY AND ANY OTHER PASSWORDS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR WALLET. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU TAKE APPROPRIATE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE SUCH SECURITY, WHICH MAY INCLUDE MAINTAINING A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX AT A REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF CONTROL OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY ASSOCIATED WITH THE WALLET.

<strong>6. Virtual Currency Transactions.</strong>

<strong>(a)</strong> Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency public ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third-parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by Cobo. Virtual Currency networks are operated by decentralized networks of independent third parties. Cobo has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the relevant Virtual Currency network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process the transaction.

<strong>(b)</strong> No Storage or Transfer of Title of Virtual Currency. A Virtual Currency is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the underlying Virtual Currency network. The Services do not store, send or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer of title that might occur in any Virtual Currency occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Virtual Currency network and not within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency.

<strong>(c)</strong> No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Virtual Currency network via the Services, the Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. Cobo has no control over any Virtual Currency network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.

<strong>7. Disclaimers.</strong>

<strong>(a)</strong> No Password Retrieval. Cobo does not receive or store your Wallet Password, Mnemonic Phrase, or the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Wallet Password retrieval. Our Services cannot generate a new Password for your Wallet. You are solely responsible for remembering your Wallet Password and Mnemonic Phrase. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet Addresses and Mnemonic Phrase maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such Wallet Addresses will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet Password and/or Mnemonic Phrase.

<strong>(b)</strong> Discontinuation of the Services. We may, in our sole discretion and without cost to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any Mnemonic Phrase, private key or other associated passwords, as you may not be able to access Virtual Currency maintained in your Wallet in the event that we discontinue or deprecate the Services.

<strong>(c)</strong> Relationship. Nothing in these Terms is intended to nor shall create any partnership, joint venture, agency, consultancy or trusteeship, you and Cobo being with respect to one another independent contractors.

<strong>(d)</strong> Accuracy of Information; Responsibility for Activities. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that Cobo is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype a public key or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services. You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Wallet and accept all risks of any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.

<strong>(e)</strong> Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Cobo is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Virtual Currency transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency transactions.

<strong>(f)</strong> Disclaimer. THE SERVICES, HARDWARE AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth in the "Dispute Resolution" section below, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Cobo are not required to arbitrate will be a court of competent jurisdiction located in Hong Kong, and you and Cobo each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Notwithstanding the above, if you are a citizen of the People's Republic of China and are located outside the United States, you consent that any dispute arising from or in connection with these Terms and Conditions shall be submitted to China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) for arbitration, which shall be conducted in Beijing in accordance with the CIETAC's arbitration rules in effect at the time of applying for arbitration.

<strong>18. Dispute Resolution.</strong> The following terms of this "Dispute Resolution" section only apply if you are an individual who is using the Services and Content for your own personal use and are not representing a legal entity.

<strong>(a)</strong> Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, "<strong>Disputes</strong>") will be resolved <strong>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</strong>. However, if for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, <strong>you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.</strong>

<strong>(b)</strong> Exceptions and Opt-out. As limited exceptions to Section 19(a) above: (i) you may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights. In addition, <strong>you will retain the right to opt out of arbitration entirely and litigate any Dispute,</strong> if you provide us with written notice of your desire to do soby email at <u>support@cobo.com</u> or by regular mail at [FLAT/AM A 20/F KIU FU COMMERCIAL BLDG, 300 LOCKHART ROAD, WAN CHAI, HONG KONG] within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms.

<strong>(c)</strong> Starting Arbitration. If you want to begin arbitrating a Dispute, you must send a letter to us at the following address [FLAT/AM A 20/F KIU FU COMMERCIAL BLDG, 300 LOCKHART ROAD, WAN CHAI, HONG KONG] requesting arbitration and describing the Dispute. If we want to begin arbitrating a Dispute, we'll send such a letter to you at the email address or street address that you provided.

<strong>(d)</strong> Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") or a comparable arbitral body (e.g., JAMS), in the event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration). The AAA Rules are available at <u>www.adr.org</u> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g., by videoconference) or in-person in the county where you live (or at some other location that we both agree to).

<strong>(e)</strong> Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We'll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000 USD, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we'll pay all of our attorneys' fees and costs and won't seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.

<strong>(f)</strong> Class Action Waiver.   <strong>YOU AND COBO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING</strong>.  Further, if the parties' dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.

<strong>(g)</strong> Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of "Changes to Terms or Services" section above, if Cobo changes any of the terms of this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <u>support@cobo.com</u>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Cobo s email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Cobo in accordance with the terms of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

<strong>19. General Terms.</strong>

<strong>(a)</strong> Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Cobo and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Cobo and you regarding the Services and Content. With the exception of any provisions in the "Class Action Waiver" section of these Terms, if any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Cobo's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Cobo may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction.
